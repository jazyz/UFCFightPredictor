# V4 Alpha Model

The new and improved UFC AI model is consistently averaging around $100 profit over the past year of UFC events in 2023, when starting with $1000 (10% profit). With a robust accuracy of 64%, it can accurately identify winning percentages of each fighter which is used in the Kelly Criterion to determine how much to bet on each fight. The best result we have simulated was turning $1000 on February 22, 2022 to $3042.19 by December 16, 2023, as well as averaging $1600 on this time period, which shows what could possibly happen in the long term if the model learns the fighting meta well. Previous research studies have found accuracies maxing out at around 63-64%. The code and process can be viewed at https://github.com/jazyz/UFCFightPredictor.
