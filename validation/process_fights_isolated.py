"""
Isolated feature processing for walk-forward validation.

This module provides a stateless feature processor that can compute features
up to any cutoff date, proving that no future data leaks into predictions.

Key differences from process_fights_alpha.py:
- No global state (fighter_stats is instance variable)
- Can process up to any cutoff date
- Returns DataFrame instead of writing files
- Provides verification methods for fighter stats at specific dates
